# AI Roadmap for NeoTerm

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for integrating and enhancing AI capabilities within the NeoTerm project.

## Phase 1: Core AI Assistant (Current Focus)

- [x] **Basic Chat Completion**: Integrate with OpenAI (GPT-4o) and Ollama for text generation.
- [x] **Contextual Awareness**: Provide AI with current working directory, recent commands, and file system summary.
- [x] **Command Generation**: Enable AI to generate shell commands from natural language queries.
- [x] **Error Explanation & Fix Suggestion**: Allow AI to explain command errors and suggest fixes.
- [x] **Streaming Responses**: Implement streaming for AI responses to improve user experience.
- [x] **Provider Fallback**: Implement fallback mechanism to a secondary AI provider if the primary fails.
- [x] **Local-Only Mode**: Option to restrict AI usage to local models (e.g., Ollama) for privacy/offline use.
- [x] **Sensitive Info Redaction**: Redact sensitive information from context sent to cloud AI providers.
- [x] **Basic Usage Quota Display**: For cloud providers (e.g., OpenAI).

## Phase 2: Proactive AI Agent

- [ ] **Autonomous Agent Mode**: Develop an agent that can understand goals, break them down into steps, and execute commands/tools autonomously.
- [ ] **Tool Integration**:
    - [ ] **File System Tools**: Read, write, list, create, delete files/directories.
    - [ ] **Shell Execution Tool**: Execute arbitrary shell commands.
    - [ ] **Network Tools**: Make HTTP requests, interact with APIs.
    - [ ] **Code Analysis Tools**: Integrate with language servers or static analysis tools.
- [ ] **Interactive Prompts**: Agent can ask clarifying questions or request user input during execution.
- [ ] **Workflow Inference**: AI can infer multi-step workflows from complex natural language requests and suggest them to the user.
- [ ] **Self-Correction**: Agent can detect and attempt to fix its own errors during execution.
- [ ] **Learning & Adaptation**: Agent learns from successful and failed attempts to improve future performance.

## Phase 3: Advanced AI Features

- [ ] **Code Generation & Refactoring**: AI can generate code snippets, refactor existing code, or suggest improvements.
- [ ] **Debugging Assistance**: AI can analyze stack traces, logs, and code to suggest debugging steps.
- [ ] **Natural Language Interface for System Management**: Manage processes, services, and system configurations using natural language.
- [ ] **Personalized AI**: AI adapts to user's coding style, preferred tools, and common tasks.
- [ ] **Multi-Modal AI**: Integrate image analysis (e.g., for UI suggestions from screenshots) or voice input.
- [ ] **AI-Powered Search**: Semantic search across command history, files, and documentation.

## Phase 4: AI Infrastructure & Scalability

- [ ] **Local LLM Integration**: Deeper integration with local LLM runtimes (e.g., Llama.cpp, Candle) for more diverse local model support.
- [ ] **Fine-tuning Capabilities**: Allow users to fine-tune models on their own data for specialized tasks.
- [ ] **Distributed AI**: Leverage local compute resources for complex AI tasks.
- [ ] **Security Auditing**: Implement robust security measures for AI interactions, especially with sensitive data.

## Metrics for Success:

- **User Adoption**: Percentage of users actively using AI features.
- **Task Completion Rate**: How often AI successfully helps users complete tasks.
- **Error Reduction**: Decrease in user-reported errors after AI intervention.
- **Performance**: Latency and throughput of AI responses.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Monitoring and optimizing API costs for cloud AI.
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on the helpfulness and accuracy of AI.
